6.What is asynchronous routing? How lazy loading differes from preloading?

//in single page everything loads for firsttime, one startegray bundkle size small(this is not answer for this)
so to make size small, 

lazy load->admin and user->on demand
normal user dont have to load admin part


shopping cart->in this scnerio user will come here and but also know user don't come immediately so preloading


background loading->preloading


DisAdvantage single page web
intial loading takes time
